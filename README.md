DevMC is what I'm calling a "mod development interface utility" aiming to be something similar to MCreator, except less restrictive, open source, and aimed more at experienced modders rather than beginners to allow for faster prototyping and iteration of Fabric mods.

## Using

DevMC is still in very early stages, so it will not be available to use for some time. You can always build it yourself though!
